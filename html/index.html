      <p>I am studying to be an IT professional specializing in full stack development. I am attending <a href = "http://skilldistillery.com/" target = "blank">Skill Distillery</a> to learn the skills I need to get ahead in a new career.</p>
      <p>My prior work experience has been in law enforcement, both as a student officer and then thirteen years in dispatch at Colorado State University. My position as a dispatcher trained me to pay attention to detail, work well in stressful  environments, and provide an excellent attitude toward customer service, both internal and external.</p>
      <p>I left law enforcement to attend Skill Distillery because I wanted a new challenge and a new career. I am looking forward to new challenges and opportunities in my new field.</p>
  		<p>Programming appealed to me because I enjoy learning how we communicate with the world. Programming languages are another form of communication, giving us beautiful ways of speaking to the world and translating tools into user experiences.</p>
  		<p>My goal is to become a lifetime learner and an expert in my field. I want to learn how to craft elegant solutions to problems and find new ways to develop the online world. My degrees in psychology and sociology allow me to understand basic motivations and better understand the needs underlying user stories. Using my MFA in creative writing will allow me to create easy-to-understand guides for processes and protocols as well as well-crafted web content.</p>
      <p>I have always enjoyed peeling back the curtain to see how things work. Being able to manipulate the software universe and build new and artful things appeals to me, especially since the tools are there for the taking. Programming languages may be arcane, but they are not unapproachable for people who have a grasp of logic and symmetry. I believe I am one of those people and I am looking forward to seeing what I can learn and accomplish as a computer programmer.</p>
